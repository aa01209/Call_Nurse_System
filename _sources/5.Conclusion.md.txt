# 5. Conclusion

This project is aimed to connect the specific component of the FPGA Boolean board and 
Active buzzer using the HDL Verilog. Where in Verilog is used to describe the behaviour
and the functionality of Call Nurse System circuit in top module which contains the
other sub-modules required to complete the design and will get converted into digital 
circuit during synthesis. 
 
During the implementation of this project, I have learned about circuit design for
debouncing circuit as well as seven segment displays. 

The most challenges that I faced were related to converting the concept into Verilog 
code so I have solved that by verification through simulation and timing analysis.

Another challenge that I faced was when I was writing the testbench code for the 
entire top module which required more simulation time without providing the proper 
data required. To solve this issue, I have made testbench for each sub module.
