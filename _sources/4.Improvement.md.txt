# 4. Improvement 

This project can be further developed by employing a wire/wireless calling system for  
Two-way communication which offers a flexibility of communication between two sides.

Two-way communication systems ensure that greater distances are covered for a more 
streamlined communication. The easier you can communicate within your facility using 
two-way call nurse system, the greater your efficiency at work for better service and 
better conditions for the staff.
