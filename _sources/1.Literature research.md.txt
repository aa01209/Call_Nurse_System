# 1. Literature research

This FPGA project is aimed to show how the communication is established between 
the patients and nurse’s reception area in a hospital. This project gives an
indication with patient bed number, buzzer and blinking LED for alarming the 
nurse's reception area that the patient needs help. 

The idea of this project comes from my previous work experience as technical trainer,
I installed this device in office building which was used to communicate between the 
service office and other offices, for example if the manager is calling then his office
number will be shown on the display. Based on that, each number indicates a specific call
of help as shown below ↓.


- Number one   &rarr; Manager Office   
- Number two   &rarr; Manager Assistant Office
- Number three &rarr; Chief Executive Office
- Number four  &rarr; Chief Operating Office 
- Number five  &rarr; Chief Financial Office 
- Number six   &rarr; Chief Information Office 
- Number seven &rarr; Chief Technology Office
