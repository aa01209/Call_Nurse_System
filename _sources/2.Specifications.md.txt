# 2. Specifications

The call nurse system is taken from a daily routine in the hospital
and the image below displays that

<p align="center"> Fig.2.2: Fig.2.1 One-way Communication of Call Nurse System </p>

### Real life scenario

Basically, if the patient in the Hospital needs aid, he/she will push the button 
mounted near the bed. As a result, the nurses’ reception area will get an alert 
that patient asking for help.
 
But, to describe this process in the Hardware Description Language (HDL)
and implemented on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. 
## Functionality  

I will explain the Functionality of the project in two case scenarios

### Case 1 

If one patient pushes on the help **push-button-switch**

- The patient room **green LED** start blinking.
- The Nurse’s Reception area is alarmed by the **Active Buzzer** which rings and the **red LED** starts to blink continuously.
- The **Seven Segment Display1** will show the patient bed number.
- If the nurse pushes the **reset button**, the bed number on **Seven Segment Display1** 
should vanish and the counter should count 1(number of times nurse is called) and 
display that on **seven segments Display2**, but the patient room **green LED** should keep
blinking continuously unless the nurse enters the patient room and **resets** it.
- The **Active Buzzer** will stop only when the nurse pushes **reset button**.

### Case 2 

If two patients or more push on the help **push-button-switch** at the same time. 
- The patient room **green LED** start blinking.
- the **Active buzzer** in the reception should turn on.
- the **red LED** in the reception should continuously blink.
- the **Seven Segments Display1** shows the patient beds number one after other

- if the 1st nurse pushes on the **reset button**, the 1st bed number on **Seven Segments Display1**
should vanish and the counter should count 1 and display that on **seven segments Display2**,
but the patient room **green LED** should be blinking continuously unless the nurse 
enters the patient room and **resets** it.

- The 2nd room number should be visible on the **seven segments Display1** and the reception
**red LED** keeps glowing until the second nurse comes 
- If the 2nd nurse pushes the **button** in the reception, the orders should be clear onto 
the **Seven Segment Display1**, and the counter should count and shows 2 on the
**seven segments Display2** but the patient room **green LED** should be blinking continuously
unless the nurse enters the patient room and **resets** it. 
- The **Active Buzzer** will stop only when the nurse pushes **reset button**.

After understanding the functionality of the one-way communication of 
Call Nurse system, now what are the inputs and the outputs on the FPGA
Boolean board and how to connect the Active Buzzer with board? 

## Components

The following image illustrates the inputs, output and the connection of
the Active Buzzer on the Boolean Board

<p align="center"> Fig.2.2 Boolean board inputs and outputs that are used in the project </p>  


The Call Nurse system consists of 2 major hardware components which are:

- FPGA board: Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S50-CSGA324, and it was provided by 
  [Deggendorf Institute of Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/) from [Realdigital website](https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/boolean).  
- Active Piezo Buzzer which also was provided by [Deggendorf Institute of Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/) from [Sensorkit website](https://sensorkit.joy-it.net/de/)        

In the Image above the inputs and the output representation is 

### Input 
- Selectors (Switches) &rarr; patient ask for help 
- Push button  &rarr; to reset the seven-segment display one and turn off the buzzer 
- Clock  &rarr; Main clock of the Boolean board(100MHz)

### Output 
-	Seven segment disply1 &rarr; Bed Number on Seven Segment Display one  
-	Seven segment disply2 &rarr; Number of orders on Seven Segment Display two 
-	RGB0 &rarr;  only red LED is used to alarm the reception 
-	Led (0-15) &rarr;Green LED for patient room 
-	PMODC pins &rarr; Active Buzzer to alarm the reception
