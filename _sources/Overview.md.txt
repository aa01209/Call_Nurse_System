Alarm system is one of the most vital devices that used in Industries and Domestic 
applications e.g., Schools, factories, Malls, Housing, Banks etc. and help us to

The Nurse Call System is the most important system of communication for daily 
nursing and emergencies. The purpose of a Nurse Call System is to create a 
convenient communication channel and improve the service of the hospital. 
With 1-way communication, the system allows nurses to attend to the patient
in-need and efficiently diagnose the patient in a timely manner.
The nurse call systems employ push button switches mounted near hospital beds
that facilitate patients to alert a centralized base station for seeking the 
attention of the nurses or other health care staffs.
